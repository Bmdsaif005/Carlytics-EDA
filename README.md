# Carlytics-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on used car sales data to uncover insights about pricing, trends, and key features.


This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a car sales dataset containing listings and attributes related to used cars. The data includes various features such as Price, Brand, Year, Fuel Type, Transmission, Power, and Mileage.

# Dataset Source: Uploaded manually 

# Project Objectives
Understand key factors affecting car prices.

Explore patterns and trends in the car resale market.

Visualize relationships between car attributes.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for better analysis.

Identify insights for decision-making in used car purchases or sales.

# Data Cleaning Steps
Removed irrelevant or mostly null columns.

Filled missing values where appropriate.

Dropped rows with excessive nulls after imputation.

Ensured uniformity in formatting (e.g., standardizing units or values).

# Outlier Handling
Detected and removed outliers using appropriate thresholds.

Replotted visuals post-cleaning to observe real trends without distortion.

# EDA Insights & Visualizations
Some of the key questions explored:

Which car brands are listed most frequently?

How does fuel type affect car pricing?

Are newer models priced significantly higher than older ones?

Is there a correlation between horsepower and price?

How do transmission types influence average car price?

Which brands are associated with premium pricing?

How do different features correlate with each other?

Visuals were created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, focusing on simple, clean plots (excluding boxplots with visible outliers).
